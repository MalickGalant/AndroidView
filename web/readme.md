## Implementing AdSense Custom Search Ads on your site is a 3 step process:

## Step 1: Create your custom search style in AdSense

### After signing in, expand Ads for search then click Search styles. From here you can create a new style or update an existing one.

# Step 2: Configure the code

## Click Get Code Embed. Configure your ad containers to match the ad containers on your search page.

## Step 3: Implement the code

### Copy the code from the code generator and paste it on your page, remembering to update the query parameter. The code generated in the head tag should be placed in the head tag on your site for the ads to load properly. The code for ad unit 1 will contain the settings for all ad units on the page. Additional ad units will only require placing the corresponding ad unit <div> on the page where ads should appear.

The most commonly used features are supplied in the code generator, but some additional parameters are available in the reference section. The reference section contains all page level options, which apply to all ad units on the page, as well as all unit level options, which apply to individual ad units.
Sample code

The generated code is asynchronous. 

A full working example of asynchronous ad loading is shown below. You may open this example in new tab. Remember to put your own client-Id.
